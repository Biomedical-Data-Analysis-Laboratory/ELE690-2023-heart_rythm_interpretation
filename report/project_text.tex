Heart rhythm interpretation using convolutional neural network

In cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the patient is treated with heart compressions, ventilations and electroshock. During this treatment, the patient responds, among other things, by changing the heart rhythm either spontaneously or after an electric shock.

A lot of work has been done to develop methods to remove compression noise from the ECG, detect treatment sequences, develop methods to automatically interprete heart rhythms and create indicators for patient condition and treatment quality.

In this study, we want to use deep learning models to further develop the existing methods for rhythm interpretation.

When it comes to the methodological approach, one can use convolutional networks combined with a traditional classification network as a starting point. Furthermore, one can explore other strategies such as the use of recursive neural networks (RNN), multiple instance learning and the use of bagging.
